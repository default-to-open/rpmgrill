This is rpmgrill, a set of analysis tests that run against a
particular RPM build. It principally differs from
https://fedoraproject.org/wiki/Common_Rpmlint_issues[rpmlint]
in that rpmgrill handles *builds*, that is, the entire set of
RPMs built from one source RPM.

For example, rpmgrill can warn about missing man pages; "make" errors
or warnings buried in the build logs; or common spec file mistakes.
rpmgrill does not know about baselines or previous builds; it does
no comparisons, only isolated analysis of one build.

Testing Your Builds
-------------------

Terminology
~~~~~~~~~~~

A *build* refers to a collection of RPMs built from a single
source RPM (which is included in the build). For purposes of
this document, builds are assumed to be generated by
http://koji.fedoraproject.org/koji/[koji].

Invoking
~~~~~~~~

The rpmgrill tool tests not only RPM files themself, but also auxiliary files
(e.g. the build log). The simplest way to start is to use the koji client to
download your RPMs including logs and run rpmgrill over them.

[source,bash]
----
$ mkdir testdir && cd testdir
$ koji download-task --logs <task id>
$ rpmgrill-unpack .  # unpack all rpms in the current directory
$ rpmgrill unpacked  # the unpacked directory is created by rpmgrill-unpack
----

rpmgrill runs silently, although there may be occasional output
to stdout or stderr during development of tests. These messages are
not preserved anywhere; they are intended for development and for
detecting rare problems.

Results
~~~~~~~

Three data files, same thing in different formats:

    rpmgrill.json
    rpmgrill.xml
    rpmgrill.yaml

These files contain standard information describing the build
being tested (N-V-R, data analyzed, version of the tools) and
zero or more reports from failing tests.

Development
-----------

To add, extend, or fix individual rpmgrill tests see README.devel-tests

For deeper development, such as ongoing maintenance or infrastructure
development (or perhaps infrastructure bug fixes), see README.devel-deep

Reporting Bugs
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

https://bugzilla.redhat.com/enter_bug.cgi?product=rpmgrill[rpmgrill] in
Bugzilla.

You can browse existing bugs filed against the

Nightly Builds
--------------

Easy installable packages are available via
https://copr.fedorainfracloud.org/coprs/romanofski/rpmgrill/[Fedora copr].

Debugging test failures in Fedora Copr
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In case tests fail in the copr builds, you can run the mock command locally.
Here is an example illustrating the process:

[source, bash]
----
# create an archive of the current release (check the spec file)
# Also note, that this makes an archive from the current HEAD. Whatever is not
# in a commit in git will not be part of the archive.
$ git archive --format=tar --prefix=rpmgrill-0.30/ HEAD | gzip > 0.30.tar.gz

# copy it into your rpmbuild directory
$ mv 0.30.tar.gz ~/rpmbuild/SOURCES

# create an src.rpm from your local spec file and the created archive
$ rpmbuild -bs rpmgrill.spec

# build it in mock which runs the tests
$ mock -r fedora-26-x86_64 --rebuild ~/rpmbuild/SRPMS/rpmgrill-0.30-1.fc25.src.rpm

# Now log in and debug. Don't forget --no-clean.
$ mock -r fedora-26-x86_64 --no-clean --shell

Changelog
---------
v0.33 (2018-06-04)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* `rpmgrill` will not record a failure any more if a config file will not
  have a corresponding man page. (Thanks to Adam Williamson)
* The deprecated scripts `rpmgrill-fetch-build` and `rpmgrill-analyze-local`
  have been removed.

v0.32 (2017-11-03)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* rpmgrill will not warn anymore if scripts use dynamic UIDs, based on a patch
  contributed by Colin Walters

v0.31 (2017-09-05)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
* `rpmgrill-unpack-rpms`: now also attempts in copying downloaded build logs from
  Koji into unpacked sub directories.
* `rpmgrill-fetch-build` and `rpmgrill-analyze-local` marked as deprecated and
  will be removed in the next release.
* `rpmgrill` will now exit with an exit code of 1 to indicate the test run had
  failures and 0 to indicate a success.
* `rpmgrill` now recognizes executables linked with new dtags (BIND_NOW) (Petr
  Pisar).
