About This README
=================

This document describes the rpmgrill tool from the perspective of
a maintenance developer. It is targeted at someone familiar with
Fedora build processes (Koji)) and with Perl. It also assumes some
familiarity with rpmgrill itself, the idea behind it, how it runs,
what it generates. See README.AAA_FIRST for an introduction at
that level.

This is *all* of rpmgrill. If you merely need to add/fix *individual
tests*, see README.devel-tests.

The intuitive starting point would be `bin/rpmgrill`. That's the executable
script. There's not much in it, though; it's principally a wrapper
for `lib/RPM/Grill.pm`. So take a look at it, run it a few times,
and move on.

`lib/RPM/Grill.pm`
