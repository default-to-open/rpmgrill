Testing Your Builds
-------------------

Invoking
~~~~~~~~

The simplest way to start, for a given package NVR, is:

[source,bash]
----
$ export NVR=coreutils-8.15-10.fc17
$ rpmgrill-fetch-build $NVR my-$NVR
$ rpmgrill my-$NVR
----

rpmgrill runs silently, although there may be occasional output
to stdout or stderr during development of tests. These messages are
not preserved anywhere; they are intended for development and for
detecting rare problems.

Results
~~~~~~~

Three data files, same thing in different formats:

    rpmgrill.json
    rpmgrill.xml
    rpmgrill.yaml

These files contain standard information describing the build
being tested (N-V-R, data analyzed, version of the tools) and
zero or more reports from failing tests.

Retrieving Builds from Koji
---------------------------

Builds can be retrieved with the `bin/rpmgrill-fetch-build` command:

[source,bash]
----
# by default uses Fedora's Koji instance to retrieve builds from
$ bin/rpmgrill-fetch-build ldapvi-1.7-20.fc22 ldapvi

# previous command is equivalent to
$ bin/rpmgrill-fetch-build \
  --server-url http://koji.fedoraproject.org/kojihub \
  --top-url http://kojipkgs.fedoraproject.org \
  ldapvi-1.7-20.fc22 ldapvi

# use other koji instances, e.g. CentOS
$ bin/rpmgrill-fetch-build \
  --server-url=http://cbs.centos.org/kojihub/ \
  --top-url=http://cbs.centos.org/kojifiles \
  ebay-cors-filter-1.0.1-3.el7 ebay-cors-filter
----

How to Debug Problems Fetching Builds
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If the script returns an error, you can use two arguments to control the
output from the script and Koji, which may provide valuable information
debugging the problem.

You can use:

`--debug`::
    This prints the XML send and received from Koji.

`--verbose`::
    This provides verbose output as to what is happening and where
    builds are stored.
